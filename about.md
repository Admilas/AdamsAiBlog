# About Me

Hi, I'm **Adam Bercaw**, a data analyst and AI enthusiast based in Seattle.

I created this blog to share how artificial intelligence can enhance the way we work with data — from building better visualizations to automating complex analysis and improving decision-making.

My background spans:

- 📊 **Data Analysis** – Turning raw data into insights using Python, Pandas, and SQL  
- 📈 **Data Visualization** – Crafting clear, compelling visuals with Matplotlib, Tableau and PowerBI  
- 🤖 **AI Tools** – Leveraging LLMs like ChatGPT to boost productivity, spark creativity, and solve real-world challenges  
- 🧗‍♂️ **Education & Outdoor Leadership** – Designing and teaching climbing programs that blend critical thinking with adventure

This blog is my way of documenting what I learn, building in public, and hopefully helping others along the way. Whether you're a beginner just starting out or an experienced developer exploring AI, I hope you'll find something useful here.
